## 1. Project Overview

Gimme is a mobile-first web app for tracking golf side games, scores, handicaps, and money between friends. Players sign in, set up courses and player profiles, start a round with a chosen game type and buy-in, score hole-by-hole on the course, and settle up payouts at the end. The app supports 11 game types, multi-group events, tournaments, real-time collaborative scoring, and in-app payment integration.

## 4. Data Model

## 5. Architecture Notes

- **Single-page app** — screen state managed via `useState<Screen>` in App.tsx (27 screens)
- **No router** — all navigation is state-driven with pushState/popstate for browser back button
- **DB naming** — snake_case in Supabase, camelCase in TypeScript, mapped via functions in `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- **Auth states** — `undefined` = loading (spinner), `null` = not authenticated (Auth screen), `Session` = authenticated (app)
- **Handicap math** — USGA formula in `src/lib/gameLogic.ts`: `courseHcp = round(index * slope/113 + (rating - par))`
- **WHS handicap** — Full World Handicap System calculation in `src/lib/handicap.ts` using 20 most recent differentials
- **Game logic** — Complete scoring/payout engines for all 11 game types in `src/lib/gameLogic.ts` (~1,550 lines)
- **Realtime** — Supabase Realtime for score sync (hole_scores), notifications (INSERT events), and presence (online indicators in events)
- **Offline support** — `src/lib/offlineQueue.ts` queues score writes when offline, flushes on reconnect
- **Home refresh** — `homeKey` state incremented on navigation back, forces component remount + data refetch
- **SECURITY DEFINER RPCs** — Admin functions and cross-user operations (e.g., round invite notifications) use Supabase RPCs that bypass RLS with internal authorization checks
- **Env vars** — `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set as GitHub repo variables

## 6. Future Features (Priority Order)

### P0 — High Value
1. **Press mechanics for Skins/Nassau** — Player-initiated double-or-nothing mid-round (core competitive feature)
2. **Push notifications** — Service worker push for round invites, score updates, settlement reminders
3. **GHIN handicap auto-sync** — Pull latest handicap from USGA GHIN API

### P1 — Nice to Have
4. **Share scorecard screenshot** — Generate image of scorecard/leaderboard for text/social sharing
5. **Email notifications** — Round invites, settlement reminders, weekly stats summary
6. **Treasurer audit dashboard** — Review all scores, payouts, payment statuses, flag disputes
7. **Full PWA service worker** — Offline caching beyond score entry, app icon and splash screen

### P2 — Future Vision
8. **Social login** — Google and Apple sign-in
9. **GPS-based "Find Games Near Me"** — Discover open events at nearby courses
10. **In-app payment processing** — Stripe/Venmo API for direct payments instead of deep linking
11. **Weather integration** — Current conditions and wind for the course location
12. **Data export** — CSV/PDF export of rounds, stats, and ledger
13. **AI caddie** — Course strategy suggestions based on handicap and hole layout
14. **Platform fees** — Optional admin/platform fee per round or per player
